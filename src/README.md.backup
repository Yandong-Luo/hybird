### README
#### Current Function:
- Using the keyboard to control the hybird to finish the task

#### Current issues:
If you try to compile these code, maybe you will get a lots of errors. I will write down a .sh file to Install all dependencies
#### Next step:
- Based on RRT algorithm to realize hybird autonomously finish the SLAM task.
- Using CV to detect the spherical object and use the arm to pick up it.
- Optimizing sensor data using the Kalman filter algorithm.
- Try to use RL to train the arm Pick up a "racquet", keep the ball bouncing on the surface without falling, and transport the ball back to the designated position (if we still have time).
